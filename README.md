Use R to implement data analytics including multiple linear regression, summary statistics and t-Tests

## Resources
* Data: MechaCar MPG dataset (csv), Suspension Coil dataset (csv)
* Software: R for Windows 4.1.3
* Libraries: dplyr from tidyverse package

## Purpose
With AutosRUs newest prototype – the MechaCar – suffering from manufacturing issues, R statistics were employed to improve production by better understanding:
* Which variables best predict prototype miles per gallon (mpg).
* The summary statistics of pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils.
* Whether or not statistical differences exist between manufacturing lots and the mean population.
* How to best compare MechaCar vehicle performance to the competition.

## Findings
### Linear Regression to Predict MPG
